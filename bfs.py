    BFS: Shortest Reach in a Graph

    Consider an undirected graph consisting of  nodes where each node is labeled from  to  and the edge between any two nodes is always of length . We define node  to be the starting position for a BFS. Given a graph, determine the distances from the start node to each of its descendants and return the list in node number order, ascending. If a node is disconnected, it's distance should be .
